This note book will use "default of credit card clients Data Set" from UCI Machine learning repository.

I will apply a preprocessing on the dataset and then try to predic default credit cards using three machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Simple Neural Networks.

Additional data dimention reduction using Principal Component Analysis is also applied.
